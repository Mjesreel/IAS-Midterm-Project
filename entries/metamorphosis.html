                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Metamorphosis was one of the most challenging experiences I've had. The system kept changing, hiding information under layers of obfuscation. It taught me that persistence and lateral thinking are just as important as technical skills.
                </p>

                <h3>Layered Obfuscation</h3>
                <p>
                    Obfuscation means hiding or disguising something to make it hard to understand. In this challenge, information was hidden in multiple layers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encoded strings that needed to be decoded</li>
                    <li>Hidden files and directories</li>
                    <li>Encrypted data that required finding keys</li>
                    <li>Misleading clues designed to waste time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
                <p>
                    I had to reverse engineer parts of the system to understand how it worked. This meant:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading and understanding unfamiliar code</li>
                    <li>Tracing execution flow to find vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li>Identifying patterns in seemingly random data</li>
                    <li>Testing hypotheses about how things might work</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lateral Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest lesson was about lateral thinking—approaching problems from unexpected angles. When the obvious path didn't work, I had to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Question my assumptions</li>
                    <li>Look for alternative approaches</li>
                    <li>Connect seemingly unrelated pieces of information</li>
                    <li>Think creatively about what the system might be hiding</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Value of Persistence</h3>
                <p>
                    This challenge was frustrating. I hit dead ends multiple times. But I learned that persistence is crucial in penetration testing. Sometimes you need to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take breaks and come back with fresh eyes</li>
                    <li>Try the same thing in a different way</li>
                    <li>Document everything so you don't repeat mistakes</li>
                    <li>Keep pushing even when progress feels slow</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Real-world systems are complex and often deliberately obscured. Attackers use obfuscation to hide malware. Defenders need to understand these techniques to detect threats. This challenge prepared me for the messy, non-linear reality of actual security work.
                </p>
