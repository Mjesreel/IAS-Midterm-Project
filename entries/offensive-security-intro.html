                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Offensive security is about thinking like an attacker. It's not just about breaking things—it's about understanding how systems work and finding the weak spots that others might miss.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learned that ethical hackers follow a clear process. They don't just randomly try things. Instead, they work through stages: <strong>reconnaissance</strong> (gathering information), <strong>scanning</strong> (finding vulnerabilities), <strong>exploitation</strong> (using those vulnerabilities), and <strong>post-exploitation</strong> (maintaining access and covering tracks).
                </p>

                <h3>The Attacker Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    What really stood out to me was the psychology behind it all. Attackers think differently. They look at a system and ask: "What if I try this? What happens if I do that?" They think creatively and asymmetrically—meaning they don't follow the normal rules or expected paths.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, while a defender might focus on protecting the front door, an attacker might look for an open window, a weak lock on the back door, or even a way to trick someone into letting them in.
                </p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Understanding offensive security helps me become a better defender. If I know how attackers think and what they look for, I can better protect systems. It's like knowing the playbook of the opposing team—you can anticipate their moves and prepare accordingly.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offensive security is systematic, not random</li>
                    <li>Thinking like an attacker helps you defend better</li>
                    <li>Creativity and curiosity are essential skills</li>
                    <li>Every system has weaknesses—it's about finding them first</li>
                </ul>
