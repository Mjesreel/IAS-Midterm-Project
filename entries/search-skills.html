                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Search skills might sound simple, but in cybersecurity, they're incredibly powerful. I learned that knowing <strong>how</strong> to search is just as important as knowing <strong>what</strong> to search for.
                </p>

                <h3>Google Dorking</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the coolest techniques I learned is called "Google dorking." This is using advanced search operators to find specific information that's publicly available but not easy to find through normal searches.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, you can use operators like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>site:</code> to search within a specific website</li>
                    <li><code>filetype:</code> to find specific file types like PDFs or spreadsheets</li>
                    <li><code>intitle:</code> to search for words in page titles</li>
                    <li><code>inurl:</code> to search for words in URLs</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These operators can help you find exposed databases, configuration files, or sensitive documents that shouldn't be public but are.
                </p>

                <h3>OSINT Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    OSINT stands for <strong>Open Source Intelligence</strong>. It's about gathering information from publicly available sourcesâ€”websites, social media, public records, and more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The OSINT mindset is about being curious and persistent. You start with a small piece of information and follow the trail. One username might lead to a social media profile, which might reveal an email address, which might connect to other accounts.
                </p>

                <h3>Specialized Search Engines</h3>
                <p>
                    I also learned about specialized search engines beyond Google:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shodan:</strong> A search engine for internet-connected devices</li>
                    <li><strong>Censys:</strong> Similar to Shodan, for finding exposed systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Have I Been Pwned:</strong> Check if email addresses have been in data breaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Wayback Machine:</strong> View old versions of websites</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Good search skills save time and reveal information that others might miss. In penetration testing, reconnaissance is the first step, and search skills are your primary tool. The better you are at finding information, the more effective you'll be at both attacking and defending systems.
                </p>
