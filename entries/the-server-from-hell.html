                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    This challenge lived up to its name. I encountered a server that was completely misconfigured, poorly documented, and full of security holes. It was frustrating, but it taught me valuable lessons about proper system management.
                </p>

                <h3>The Dangers of Misconfiguration</h3>
                <p>
                    Misconfiguration is one of the most common security vulnerabilities. In this challenge, I found:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Services running with default passwords</li>
                    <li>Unnecessary ports left open</li>
                    <li>Outdated software with known vulnerabilities</li>
                    <li>Improper file permissions allowing unauthorized access</li>
                    <li>No firewall rules in place</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Importance of Documentation</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems was the lack of documentation. I had no idea:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What services were supposed to be running</li>
                    <li>Who had access to what</li>
                    <li>What changes had been made and why</li>
                    <li>How to properly configure the system</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This taught me that good documentation isn't optional—it's essential. When something goes wrong, you need to know how the system is supposed to work.
                </p>

                <h3>Configuration Management</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned about configuration management tools that help keep systems consistent and secure:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code:</strong> Defining server configurations in code</li>
                    <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Tracking changes to configurations</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated deployment:</strong> Ensuring consistent setup across servers</li>
                    <li><strong>Configuration auditing:</strong> Regularly checking for drift from secure baselines</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Secure Deployment Practices</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned that secure deployment means:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting with a minimal, hardened base configuration</li>
                    <li>Only installing what's actually needed</li>
                    <li>Changing all default credentials immediately</li>
                    <li>Documenting every change</li>
                    <li>Regularly reviewing and updating configurations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Most breaches don't happen because of sophisticated attacks—they happen because of simple misconfigurations. A server that's poorly set up is an easy target. This challenge showed me that proper configuration and documentation are just as important as any security tool.
                </p>
