                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Aster focused on secure communications and how data travels across networks. I learned that even if data is encrypted, it can still be intercepted if the encryption isn't implemented correctly.
                </p>

                <h3>Data in Transit vs Data at Rest</h3>
                <p>
                    There are two main scenarios for protecting data:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data at rest:</strong> Information stored on disks or databases</li>
                    <li><strong>Data in transit:</strong> Information traveling across networks</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Aster taught me about protecting data in transit—making sure that when information travels from point A to point B, no one can read it along the way.
                </p>

                <h3>TLS/SSL and HTTPS</h3>
                <p>
                    I learned how HTTPS works and why it's important. When you visit a website with HTTPS, your connection is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security). This prevents attackers from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading your passwords or credit card numbers</li>
                    <li>Modifying the data being sent</li>
                    <li>Impersonating the website you're visiting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the scariest things I learned about was man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This is when an attacker positions themselves between you and the server you're communicating with. They can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intercept and read all your messages</li>
                    <li>Modify messages before they reach their destination</li>
                    <li>Impersonate either side of the conversation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Proper encryption prevents these attacks by ensuring that even if someone intercepts the data, they can't read or modify it.
                </p>

                <h3>Certificate Validation</h3>
                <p>
                    I also learned about digital certificates and why they matter. Certificates prove that a website is who it claims to be. If you ignore certificate warnings, you might be connecting to an attacker's server instead of the real one.
                </p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost everything we do online involves data transmission—logging in, shopping, messaging. If that data isn't properly encrypted, it's vulnerable. Understanding secure communication protocols is fundamental to protecting privacy and security.
                </p>
