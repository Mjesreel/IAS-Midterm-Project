                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Defensive security is all about protection. It's the shield that keeps attackers out and detects them when they try to break in. I learned that defense isn't just one thing—it's a whole ecosystem of tools, processes, and people working together.
                </p>

                <h3>The Building Blocks of Defense</h3>
                <p>
                    There are several key components that make up a strong defense:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threat Intelligence:</strong> Knowing what threats are out there and how they work</li>
                    <li><strong>SOC Operations:</strong> Security Operations Centers that monitor systems 24/7</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Response (DFIR):</strong> Digital Forensics and Incident Response—investigating and responding to attacks</li>
                    <li><strong>SIEM Tools:</strong> Security Information and Event Management systems that collect and analyze logs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proactive vs Reactive</h3>
                <p>
                    What surprised me most was learning that good defense is <strong>proactive</strong>, not just reactive. It's not enough to wait for an attack to happen and then respond. You need to actively monitor, look for patterns, and catch threats early.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, SIEM tools collect logs from all over your network—servers, firewalls, applications. They look for unusual patterns. Maybe someone is trying to log in from a strange location, or there's a sudden spike in data transfers. These small anomalies can be early warning signs of a bigger attack.
                </p>

                <h3>The Power of Correlation</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most important skills in defensive security is <strong>log correlation</strong>. This means connecting the dots between different events. A single failed login might not mean much. But 100 failed logins from the same IP address in 5 minutes? That's a brute force attack.
                </p>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Defensive security is the foundation of keeping systems safe. Without it, all the data, applications, and services we rely on would be vulnerable. Learning about defense taught me to appreciate the constant vigilance required to keep systems secure.
                </p>

                    "Defense is not passive—it's an active, ongoing process of monitoring, analyzing, and responding to threats before they become disasters."
