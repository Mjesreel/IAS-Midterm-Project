                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about common attacks was eye-opening. I realized that most successful attacks aren't sophisticatedâ€”they exploit simple mistakes and common vulnerabilities. Understanding these attacks helps me think about security more practically.
                </p>

                <h3>Phishing</h3>
                <p>
                    Phishing is when attackers trick people into giving up sensitive information. They might send an email that looks like it's from your bank, asking you to click a link and enter your password. The link takes you to a fake website that steals your credentials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What I learned: <strong>People are often the weakest link in security.</strong> No matter how strong your technical defenses are, if someone can be tricked into handing over their password, the attacker gets in.
                </p>

                <h3>Brute Force Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    A brute force attack is when an attacker tries many different passwords until they find the right one. It's like trying every key on a keyring until one opens the door.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Modern tools can try thousands of passwords per second. That's why using strong, unique passwords is so important. A password like "password123" can be cracked in seconds. A long, random password might take years.
                </p>

                <h3>SQL Injection</h3>
                <p>
                    SQL injection happens when an attacker inserts malicious code into a web form or URL. If the website doesn't properly validate input, the attacker's code gets executed by the database.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For example, instead of entering a username, an attacker might enter: <code>' OR '1'='1</code>. This can trick the database into returning all user records or even giving the attacker admin access.
                </p>

                <h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
                <p>
                    Privilege escalation is when an attacker gains higher-level access than they should have. They might start as a regular user but find a way to become an administrator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This often happens through misconfigured permissions, unpatched software, or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the system handles user privileges.
                </p>

                <h3>How to Defend</h3>
                <p>
                    For each attack, I learned practical defenses:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> User education, email filtering, multi-factor authentication</li>
                    <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> Strong passwords, account lockouts, rate limiting</li>
                    <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Input validation, parameterized queries, least privilege</li>
                    <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Proper permissions, regular patching, monitoring</li>
                </ul>

                    "Understanding how attacks work is the first step to preventing them. Every attack teaches you something about how to build better defenses."
